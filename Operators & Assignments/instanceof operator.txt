        Operators in java 

    6. instanceof Operators(instanceof)

    -> To check the object is perticular type or not we use instanceof Operator.

    Example:-
        -> we have ArrayList l have multiple type of objects in it.
        
        Object o = l.get(0);
        if(o instanceof Student){
            Student s = (Student)o;
            //perform student specific functionality.
        } else if(o instanceof Customer){
            Customer c = (Customer)o;
            //perform customer specific functionality.
        }

    
    -> Syntex (r instanceof x) -:- r is object reference and x is any interface/class name.

    Example:- 
        -> Thread t = new Thread();
        System.out.println(t instanceof Thread); //true
        System.out.println(t instanceof Object); //true
        System.out.println(t instanceof Runnable); //true

        -> If there is no relation between two argument type then we will get compile time error.
        -> Relation like parent to child or child to parent or same type. 
        System.out.println(t instanceof String); // Compiler time error :- error: incompatible types: Thread cannot be converted to String.

    -> null instanceof x :- x is any class/interface.
        -> System.out.println(null instanceof String); // false
        -> System.out.println(null instanceof Thread); //false
        -> System.out.println(null instanceof Object); //false
        -> System.out.println(null instanceof Runnable); //false
