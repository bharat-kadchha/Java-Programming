        Operators in java 

    6. instanceof Operators(instanceof)

    -> To check the object is perticular type or not we use instanceof Operator.

    Example:-
        -> we have ArrayList l have multiple type of objects in it.
        
        Object o = l.get(0);
        if(o instanceof Student){
            Student s = (Student)o;
            //perform student specific functionality.
        } else if(o instanceof Customer){
            Customer c = (Customer)o;
            //perform customer specific functionality.
        }
