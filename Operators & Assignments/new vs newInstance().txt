    new keyword vs newInstance() method in java 
        
        ** new operator **

            -> we can use new operator to create an object if we know class name at the beginning.
            -> To use new operator class not required to contain no-arg constructor.
            -> while using new operator at runtime if corrosponding class file is not available then we get runtime exception:- NoClassDefFoundError

            Test t = new Test();
            Student s = new Student(10);
            Customer c = new Customer("Yogesh");


        ** newInstance() **

            -> newInstance is a method present in class Class.
            -> we can use new instance to create object if we don't know class name at the beginning and it is available dynamically at runtime.
            -> To use newInstance() method class must have to contain no-arg constructor.
            -> while using newiInstance() method at runtime if the corrosponding .class file is not available then we will runtime exception :- ClassNotFoundException

            Example 1:- 

                class Customer{

                } 
                class Student{

                }
                class Test{
                    public static void main(String[] args){
                        Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newiInstance();
                        System.out.println("Object created for:" + o.getClass().getName());
                    }
                }

            Example 2:-

                -> In java web application web container create object of servlet based on web request using newInstance() method.
