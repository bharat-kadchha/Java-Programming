    Operators in java 

3. String Concadination.

    -> In java operator overloading is not available accept "+" operator.
    -> In java operator calculation based on it's precident.
   
    -> "Yogesh"+10 -> output:- Yogesh10
    -> string + number -> String

    -> 10 + 20 -> output:- 30
    -> number + number -> number


    -> Consider the following assignment
        String a = "Yogesh";
        int b = 10, c = 20, d = 30;

    Case 1. 
        -> System.out.println(a+b+c+d);
        output:- Yogesh102030;
        -> String + number -> string

    Case 2.
        -> System.out.println(b+c+d+a);
        output:- 60Yogesh;
        -> number + number -> number
        -> number + string -> string

    case 3.
        -> System.out.println(b+c+a+d);
        output:- 30Yogesh30;
        -> number + number -> number
        -> number + string -> string
        -> String + number -> string


NOTE:-  -> If Operator "+" applied between two integer then it behave like arithmatic operation.
        -> If operator "+" applied between string and number then it behave like concadination.
