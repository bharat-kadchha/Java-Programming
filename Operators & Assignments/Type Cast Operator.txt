        Java Operators.

    11. Type Cast operator.
        
        -> There are two type of type casting.
            1. Implicit type casting.
            2. Explicit type casting.

    1. Implicit type casting.
        -> when we assign smaller data type value to bigger data type variable.
        -> perfomed by compiler.
        -> loss less.
        -> widening.

        byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double.
        char -> int.
        All above conversions are Implicit type casting.

    2. Explicit type casting 
        -> When we assign bigger data type value to smaller data type variable.
        -> perfomed by programmer.
        -> may be a chance of loss of information.
        -> narrowing
