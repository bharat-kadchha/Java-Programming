        Java Operators.

    11. Type Cast operator.
        
        -> There are two type of type casting.
            1. Implicit type casting.
            2. Explicit type casting.

        1. Implicit type casting.
            -> when we assign smaller data type value to bigger data type variable.
            -> perfomed by compiler.
            -> loss less.
            -> widening.

            byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double.
            char -> int.
            All above conversions are Implicit type casting.

        2. Explicit type casting 
            -> When we assign bigger data type value to smaller data type variable.
            -> perfomed by programmer.
            -> may be a chance of loss of information.
            -> narrowing

            double -> float -> int -> short -> byte
            int -> char.


        Example 1:-

            int x = 130;
            byte b = x; //error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte
            System.out.println(b);

        Example 2:-

            int x = 130;
            byte b =(byte)x; 
            System.out.println(b); //-126

            -> Reason behind the Example 2 output:-
                ->  0000...0010000010 (32 bit representation because it is int type).
                -> Compress to 8 bit then the last 8 bit is considered. -> 10000010
                -> In 8 bit representation highest bit is for sign bit so the  number is 1(0000010).
                -> 1 means negative number 1(0000010).
                -> negative numbers are represented in 2's compliment form.
                -> so the 2's compliment of 1(0000010) is 1's compliment + 1.
                    1(0000010) -> 1's compliment -> 1 (1111101 + 1) -> 1(1111110) -> (-126).
                
        Example 3:-

            int x = 150;
            short s = (short) x;
            System.out.println(s);//150

            byte b = (byte) x;
            System.out.println(b);//-106

            -> As per above terminology we get output.

        Example 4:-

            double d = 130.456;
            int x = (int)d;
            System.out.println(x); //130

            byte b = (byte)d;
            System.out.println(b); //-126

            -> we we assign floting point value to the integer type then the floting point digits are disgarded.
