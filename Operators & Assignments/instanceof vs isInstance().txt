*** instanceof vs isInstance() ***
==================================

    instanceof operator:-
        -> we use instanceof operator to check whether the given object is perticular type or not and we know the type at beginning.

    
    isInstance() method:-
        -> isInstance() method is present inside class Class.
        -> we use isInstance() method to check whether the given object is perticular type or not and we don't know the type at beginning.
        -> we provide type dynamically at runtime.
