        Java Source File Structure
        --------------------------

    -> A Java program can contain any number of classes but at most one class can be declared as a public if there is public class then the name of the public class and name of program must be matched otherwise we will get compile time error.



    Case 1:- 
        -> If there is no public class then we can use any name for program file and there no restrictions.

        -> Name of file is Yogesh.java

        class A{

        }
        class B{

        }
        class c{

        }

    Case 2:-
        -> If class is public then name of program file is must be match with class name. Otherwise we will get compile time error.

        -> Name of file is B.java

        class A{

        }
        public class B{

        }
        class c{

        }

    Case 3:- 
        -> If class B and C declared as public and name of program is B.java then we will get compile time error.
        error:- class C is public, should be declared in a file named C.java


    -> when we are compiling a java program then for every class present in that program a seperate class path is generated.

    -> we can compile a java Source file(program) but we can run a java .class file.

    -> whenever we are executing a java class then the corrosponding class main method will be executed if the class does not contain main method then we will get runtime exception NoSuchMethodError : main if the corrosponding class file not found then we will get NoClassDefFoundError.

    -> It is not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single source file. It is highly recommended to declare only one class per source file and we have to match source file with class name.
