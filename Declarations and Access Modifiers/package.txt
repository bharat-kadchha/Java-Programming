        ** Package **
        =============


    -> It is an encapsulation mechanisam to group related classes and interfaces into a single unit, which is nothing but Package.
    
    Example 1 :- All classes and interfaces which are required for database operations are grouped into a single Package which is nothing but java.sql Package.
