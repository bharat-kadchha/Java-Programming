        ** Package **
        =============


        -> It is an encapsulation mechanisam to group related classes and interfaces into a single unit, which is nothing but Package.
        
        Example 1 :- All classes and interfaces which are required for database operations are grouped into a single Package which is nothing but java.sql Package.

    The main advantages of Package are:-
        -> To resolve namming conflicts (unique identification of our components).
        -> It improves modularity of the application.
        -> It improves maintainability of the application.
        -> It provide security for our components.

    -> Universely accepted namming convention is to use internate domain name in reverse.

    
    package com.yogesh.test;
    class Package {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Package...");
        }
    }

    javac Package.java

    -> Generated class file placed into current working directory.


    javac -d . Package.java

    -> -d :- destination to place generated class file.
    -> . :- means current working directory.
