     ** Import statement **
     ======================


    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        }
    }

    Output:- cannot find symbol
             symbol:   class ArrayList
             location: class 


    -> we can solve this problem by using fully qualified name.

        java.util.ArrayList l = new java.util.ArrayList();


    -> The problem with usage of fully qualified name every time is it increase length of code and reduce readablity.

    -> we can solve this problem using import statement whenever we are writing import statement is not required to use fully qualified name every time we can use short name directly.

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        }
    }
