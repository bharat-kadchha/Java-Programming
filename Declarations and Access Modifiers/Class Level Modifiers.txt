    class Level Modifiers
    =====================

    -> Whenever we are writing our own classes we have to provide some information about our class to the JVM.
    -> Whether this class is accessable from anywhere or not.
    -> Whether child class creation is allowed or not.
    -> Whether we can create object or not.
    -> Such information we will provide using access modifier.
