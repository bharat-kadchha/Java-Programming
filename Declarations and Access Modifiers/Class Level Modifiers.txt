    class Level Modifiers
    =====================

    -> Whenever we are writing our own classes we have to provide some information about our class to the JVM.
    -> Whether this class is accessable from anywhere or not.
    -> Whether child class creation is allowed or not.
    -> Whether we can create object or not.
    -> Such information we will provide using access modifier.

    The Only applicable Modifiers for TOP LEVEL classes are.
    --------------------------------------------------------
    1. public
    2. default
    3. final
    4. abstract
    5. strictfp

    For inner classes applicable Modifiers are.
    -------------------------------------------
    1. public
    2. private
    3. default
    4. final
    5. abstract
    6. static
    7. strictfp
    8. protected

    Case 1:-

        private class ClassLevelModifier {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello!!");
            }
        }

        output:- modifier private not allowed here



        Modifier public
        ---------------

    -> we class declared as a public then we can access that class form anywhere.


        Modifier default
        ----------------

    -> If a class is declared as default then we can access that class only with in the current package that is from outside package we can't access.
    -> default access is also known as package level access.
