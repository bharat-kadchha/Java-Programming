        Has - A Relationship
        ====================
    
    -> Has - A relationship is also known as composition or aggregation.
    -> There is no specific keyword to implement has - a relation but most of the times we are depending on new keyword.
    -> The main advantage of has a relationship is reusability of the code.

    Example:-

        class Engine{
            //engine specific functionality
        }

        class Car {
            Engine e = new Engine();
        } 

        -> Car has - a engine reference.
    
    Difference between composition and aggregation.
    -----------------------------------------------

        -> Without existing cotainer object if there is no chance of existing contained objects then container and contained objects are strogly associated and this strong association is nothing but composition.
        -> university contain several department without existing university there is no chance of existing department so department and university is strogly associated and this strong association is nothing but composition.

        -> Without existing container object if there is chance of existing contained object then container and contained objects are weekly associated and this week association is nothing but aggregation.
        -> Department consist of several proffesers without existing department there may be a chance of existing proffesers hence department and proffesers objects are weekly associated and this week association is nothing but aggregation.

    
    NOTE
    ----
        -> In composition objects are strongly associated whereas in aggregation objects are weekly associated.
        -> In composition container object holds directly contained objects whereas in aggregation container object holds just references of contained objects.

    IS - A vs Has - A
    -----------------
        -> If we want total functionality of the class automatically then we should go for Is - A relationship.

        -> If we want part of the functionality then we should go for Has - A relationship.
