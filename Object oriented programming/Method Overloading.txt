        Method Overloading
        ==================
    
    -> Two methods are said to be overloaded if and only if both methods having same name but different argument types.
    
    -> In c language method overloading concept is not available hence we can't declare multiple methods with the same name but different arguments type if there a change in argument type compulsary we should go for new mwthod name which increases complexity of programming.

        abs(int i)
        labs(long l)
        fabs(float f)
    
    -> In java we can declare multiple methods with same name but different argument types asuch type of methods are called overloaded methods.

        abs(int i)
        abs(long l)
        abs(float f)
    
    -> Having overloading concept in java reduces complexity of programming.

        class Test{
            public void m1(){
                System.out.println("no - arg");
            }
            public void m1(int i){
                System.out.println("int arg");
            }
            public void m1(double d){
                System.out.println("double arg");
            }
        }

        class main{
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Test t = new Test();
                t.m1();
                t.m1(10);
                t.m1(10.5);
            }
        }

    -> In overloading method resolutin always takes care by compiler based on reference types hence overloading is also considered as compile time polymorphism or static polymorphism or early binding.
