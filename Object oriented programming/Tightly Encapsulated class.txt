        Tightly Encapsulated class
        ==========================
    
    -> A class is said to be tightly encapsulated if an only if each and every variable declared as private.
    -> Whether class contains corrosponding getter and setter methods are not Whethers this method are declared as public or not this things we are not required to check.

        public class Account {
            private double balance;

            public double getBalance(){

            }
        }
    
    -> Which of following classes are tightly encapsulated class.
        Example 1:-

            class A {
                private int x = 10; //tightly encapsulated
            }
            class B extends A {
                int y = 10;
            }
            class C extends A {
                private int z = 10; //tightly encapsulated
            }

        Example 2:-

            class A {
                int x = 10;     // not tightly encapsulated
            }
            class B extends A {
                private int y = 20; // not tightly encapsulated
            }
            class C extends B {
                private int z = 30; // not tightly encapsulated
            }
    -> If the parent classes not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly encapsulated.
