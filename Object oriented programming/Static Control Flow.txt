            Static control flow 
            ===================
    
    -> When ever we are executing a java class the following sequence of steps will be executed as the part of static control flow.

        1. Identification of static member from top to bottom.
        2. Execution of static variable assignment and static block from top to bottom.
        3. Execution of main method.

    Example
    -------

        class Base{
            static int i = 10;
            static{
                m1();
                System.out.println("First Static Block");
            }
            public static void main(String[] args){
                m1();
                System.out.println("Main Method");
            }
            public static void m1(){
                System.out.println(j);
            }
            static{
                System.out.println("Second Static Block");
            }
            static int j = 20;

        }


        Output:-
        -------
            0
            First Static Block
            Second Static Block
            20
            Main Method

    -> If we try to read and display the value of a variable inside the static block, that read operation is called a direct read. If we are calling a method from a static block, and within that method, if we are trying to read a variable, that read operation is called an indirect read.
