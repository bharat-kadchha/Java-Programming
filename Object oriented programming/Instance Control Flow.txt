            Instance Control Flow
            =====================
    
    -> Whenever we are executing a java class first static control flow will be executed.
    -> In the static control flow if we are creating an object the following sequence of events will be executed as a part of instance control flow.
        1. Identification of instance member from top to bottom.
        2. execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom.
        3. execution of constructor.

    Example :-

        class Test{
            int i = 10;
            {
                m1();
                System.out.println("First Instance");
            }

            Test(){
                System.out.println("Constructor");
            }
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Test obj = new Test();
                System.out.println("Main Method");
            }
            public void m1(){
                System.out.println(j);
            }
            {
                System.out.println("Second Instance");
            }
            int j = 20;
        }

        output:- 
            0
            First Instance
            Second Instance
            Constructor
            Main Method
