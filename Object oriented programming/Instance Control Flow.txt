            Instance Control Flow
            =====================
    
    -> Whenever we are executing a java class first static control flow will be executed.
    -> In the static control flow if we are creating an object the following sequence of events will be executed as a part of instance control flow.
        1. Identification of instance member from top to bottom.
        2. execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom.
        3. execution of constructor.

    Example :-

        class Test{
            int i = 10;
            {
                m1();
                System.out.println("First Instance");
            }

            Test(){
                System.out.println("Constructor");
            }
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Test obj = new Test();
                System.out.println("Main Method");
            }
            public void m1(){
                System.out.println(j);
            }
            {
                System.out.println("Second Instance");
            }
            int j = 20;
        }

        output:- 
            0
            First Instance
            Second Instance
            Constructor
            Main Method

    NOTE
    ----
        -> Static control flow is one time activity which will be performed at the time of class loading.
        -> Instance control flow is not one time activity it will be performed for every object creation.
        -> object creation is costly operation if there is no requirement then recommended not to create.

    
            Instance control flow in Parent to child replationship
            ======================================================

    -> Whenever we are creating child object then the following sequence of events will be performed as a part of Instance control flow.
        1. Identification of Instance members from parent to child.
        2. Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks only in parent class.
        3. Execution of parent constructor.
        4. Execution of instance variable assignments and Instance blocks in child class.
        5. Execution of child constructor.


    Example:- 

        class Parent {
            int i = 10;
            {
                m1();
                System.out.println("Parent Instance Block");
            }
            Parent(){
                System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
            }
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Parent p = new Parent();
                System.out.println("Parent main");
            }
            public void m1(){
                System.out.println(j);
            }
            int j = 20;
        }

        class Child extends Parent{
            int x = 100;
            {
                m2();
                System.out.println("Child first instance block");
            }
            Child(){
                System.out.println("child Constructor");
            }
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Child  c = new Child();
                System.out.println("Child Main");
            }
            public static void m2(){
                System.out.println(j);
            }
            {
                System.out.println("Child Second Instance Block");
            }
            int j = 200;
        }

        java Child

        output:- 
            0
            Parent Instance Block
            Parent Constructor
            0
            Child first instance block
            Child Second Instance Block
            child Constructor
            Child Main
