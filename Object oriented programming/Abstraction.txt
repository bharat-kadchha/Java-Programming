        Abstraction
        ===========

    -> Hiding internal implementation and just highlight the set of services what we are offering is a concept of abstraction.

    Example:- Through bank ATM GUI screen bank people highlight the set of services what they are offering with highlight internal implementation.

    -> The main advantages of abstarction are 
        1. security
            -> We are not highlight our internal implementation.
        
        2. maintanability
            -> maintanability of the application will become easy.

        3. Enhancement is easy
            -> without affecting end user we can able to perform any type of changes in our internal system. 

        4. Easyness
            -> Without knowing internal implementation client can use our set of services.

    -> By using interfaces and abstract classes we can implment abstarction.
