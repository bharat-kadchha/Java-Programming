        Method Overridding
        ==================
    
    -> Whatever methods parents have bydefault available to the child through inheritance if child class not satisfied with parent class implementation then child is allowed to redefine that method based on it's requriment this process is overridding.

    -> The parent class method which is overridden is called overridden method.

    -> The child class method which is overridding is called overridding method.

    Example:- 

        class Parent{
            public void property(){
                System.out.println("Gold");
            }
            public void marry(){
                System.out.println("Mary");
            }
        }

        class Child extends Parent {
            public void marry(){
                System.out.println("Priyanka");
            }
        }
    
        class Test{
            public static void main(String[] args){
                Parent p = new Parent();
                p.marry();      // Mary

                Child c = new Child();
                c.marry();      //Priyanka

                Parent p1 = new Child();
                p1.marry();     // Priyanka
            }
        } 

    -> In overridding method resolution always takes care by JVM based on runtime object and hence overridding is also considered as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism or late binding.

    Rules For Overridding
    ---------------------
        1. In overridding method names and arguments type must be matched that is method signature must be same.

        2. In overridding return types must be same but this rule is applicable until 1.4 version only. but 1.5 version onwards we can take covarient return types. According to this child class method return type need not be same as parent method return type. It's child type also allowed.

            Example:- 

                class p {
                    public Object m1(){
                        return null;
                    }
                }
                class C extends P{
                    public String m1(){
                        return null;
                    }
                }

            -> Covarient return type concept is applicable only for Object Types but not for primitive types.
        
        3. Parent class private methods not available to the child and hence overridding concept not applicable for private methods.

            -> Based on our requriment we can define exectly same method in child class then it is valid but not overridding.

            Example:- 
                class P{
                    private void m1(){

                    }
                }  
                class C extends P {
                    private void m1(){

                    }
                }
        
        4. We can't override parent class final methods in child classes if we are trying to override we will get compile time error.

            Example:-

                class P {
                    public final void m1(){

                    }
                }
                class C extends P {
                    public void m1(){

                    }
                }
                
            -> m1() in C cannot override m1() in p; overridden method is final.

        5. Parent class abstract methods we should override in child class to provide implementation.

            Example :-

                abstract class P {
                    public abstract void m1();
                }
                class C extends P {
                    public void m1(){

                    }
                }

        6. We can override non abstract method as abstract.

            Example:-

                class P {
                    public void m1(){

                    }
                }
                abstract class C extends P {
                    public abstract void m1();
                }

            -> The main advantage of this approach is we can stop availability of parent method implementation in next child classes.
        

        Summary
        -------

            -> In overridding following modifiers won't keep any restrictions.
                1. synchronized
                2. strictfp
                3. native
                4. abstract

            Parent class method     final           non-final       abstract        non-abstract    synchronized        non-synchronized    native          non-native   strictfp          non-strictfp


            child class method      non-final       final           non-abstract    abstract        non-synchronized    synchronized        non-native      native       non-strictfp      strictfp

                                    Wrong           Right           Right           Right           Right               Right               Right           Right       Right               Right



        7. While overridding we can't reduce the sope of the modifier but we can increase a scope.

            class C {
                public void m1(){

                }
            }
            class C extends P {
                void m1(){

                }
            }

            compile time error :- m1() in c cannot override m1() in p; attempting to assign weaker access privilages; was public.

            Parent class method :- public      protected                default

            child class method :- public        public/protected        public/protected/default


        8. If child class method throws any checked exception then compolsary parent class method should throws same checked exception or it's parent otherwise we will get compile time error.
            -> There are no restriction on unchecked exception.

            class P {
                public void m1() throws IOExceptio{

                }
            }
            class C extends P {
                public void m1() throws EOFException, InterruptedException{

                }
            }

            Compile time error :- m1() in C cannot override m1() in P overridden method does not throw java.lang.InterruptedException


    Overridding with respect to static method
    -----------------------------------------

        1. We can't override a static method as non static otherwise we will get compile time error.

            class P {
                public static void m1(){

                }
            } 
            class C extends P {
                public void m1(){

                }
            }

            compile time error :- m1() in C cannot override m1() in p; overridden method is static.

        2. We can't override non static method as static.

            class P {
                public void m1(){

                }
            } 
            class C extends P {
                public static void m1(){

                }
            }
            
            compile time error :- m1() in C cannot override m1() in p; overridding method is static.

        3. If both parent and child class method is then we won't get any compile time error.
            -> It seems overridding concept is applicable to the static method but it is not overridding it is method hiding.

            class P {
                public static void m1(){

                }
            } 
            class C extends P {
                public static void m1(){

                }
            }

        Method hiding
        -------------

            -> All rules of method hiding is same as method overridding except following differences.

                Method hiding                   overridding

            1. Both parent and child        1. Both parent and child class
             method should be static.          methods should be non static.

            2. Compiler is responsible      2. JVM is always responsible for 
             for method resolution based        method resolution based on runtime 
             on reference type.                 object.

            3. It is also known as          3. It is also known as runtime polymorphism
            compile time polymorphism           dynamic polymorphism
            static polymorphism                 late binding.
            or early binding.

            Example:- 

                class P {
                    public static void m1(){
                        System.out.println("parent");
                    }
                }
                class C extends P {
                    public static void m1(){
                        System.out.println("Child");
                    }
                }

                class Test {
                    public static void main(String[] args){
                        P p = new P();
                        p.m1();         //parent

                        C c = new C();
                        c.m1();         //child

                        P p1 = new C();
                        p1.m1();        //parent
                    }
                }

            -> If both parent and child class method is non static then it is overridding.
            -> If both parent and child class method is static then it is method hiding.

    
    Overridding with respect to var arg methods
    -------------------------------------------
        -> We can override var arg method with another var arg method only. If we are trying to override with normal method then it will become overloading but not overridding. 

            class P {
                public void m1(int... i){
                    System.out.println("var arg")
                }
            }
            class C extends P {
                public void m1(int i){
                    System.out.println("int arg");
                }
            }
            class Test {
                public static void main(String[] args){
                    P p = new P();
                    p.m1(10);       //var arg

                    C c = new C();
                    c.m1(10);       //int arg

                    P p1 = new C();
                    p1.m1(10);      // var arg
                }
            }
            
            -> In above example if we replace child method with var arg method then it will become overridding in this case output is:-
                var arg
                int arg
                int arg


    Overridding with respect to  variables
    --------------------------------------

        -> variable resolution always takes care by compiler based on reference type irrespective of whether the variable is static or non static (Overridding concept applicable only for methods but not for variables).
        
            class P {
                int x = 888;
            }
            class C extends P {
                int x = 999;
            }

            class Test {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    P p = new P();
                    System.out.println(p.x);    // 888

                    P p1 = new C();
                    System.out.println(p1.x);   // 888

                    C c = new C();
                    System.out.println(c.x);    // 999

                }
            }
