        Data Hiding
        ===========

    -> Outside person can't access our internal data directly or our internal data should not go out directly this object oriented feature is nothing but data hiding.
    -> After validation/Authentication outside person can access our internal data.

        Example:- After providing our user name and password we can able to access our gmail inbox information.

    -> By declaring data member(variable) as private we can achieve data hiding.

        public class Account{
            private double balance;

            public double getBalance(){
                //validation
                return balance;
            }
        }

    NOTE
    ----
        -> It is highly recommended to declare data member as private.
