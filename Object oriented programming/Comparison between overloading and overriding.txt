        Comparison between overloading and overriding
        ---------------------------------------------
    
         property                                    overloading                               overriding

    1. method name                                  must be same                            must be same

    2. argument type                                must be different                       must be same

    3. final, private, static method                no restrictions                         cannot be overriden

    4. Return type                                  no restrictions                         covarient return type is allowed 

    5. throws clause                                no restrictions                         if child class method throws any checked 
                                                                                            exception compulsary parent class method 
                                                                                            should throw same checked exception 
                                                                                            or it's parent.

    6. method resolution                            compiler based on reference type        JVM based on runtime object.

    7. other names                                  compile time polymorphism               Runtime polymorphism
                                                    early binding                           late binding
                                                    static polymorphism                     dynamic polymorphism
